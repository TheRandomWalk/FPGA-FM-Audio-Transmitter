# FPGA FM Stereo Audio Transmitter

A Python program that runs on a computer performs DSP of the audio signal and transmits it to the FPGA (Digilent Cmod S7) through the virtual serial port. The FPGA then broadcasts the FM signal. Adaptation to other Xilinx 7th generation FPGAs should be trivial.

Three short videos demonstrate the quality of the output as the signal is captured with an SDR card:
- ["Messiah", Handel](https://youtu.be/4MKLYPtF3k)
- ["Tall Ships", Audionautix](https://youtu.be/g5UyYfrwCIY)
- ["When Johnny Comes Marching Home", Cooper Cannell](https://youtu.be/VvLEICFUTC4)
